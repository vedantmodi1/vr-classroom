# Virtual Classrooms -Learning in and after a Pandemic

## Objective:
### Current Issues of studying online:
- Social Isolation
This is one of the primary disadvantages faced by students. A lack of interaction with the teachers and their peers hampers learning. Group studies and after class interactions are essential to education. This also translates into lack of communication skills.
- Requires Strong Motivation
In physical classes, we often take our partners’ help in understanding what is being taught. Students often hesitate to interrupt the entire class and clarify. This leaves learning incomplete.
- Lacks Face to Face Interaction

- Inhibits Doubt Solving

### What is the Solution?
Classes backed by virtual reality and supported by custom animated versions of students and teachers can prove to be the solution to this problem.
The global virtual reality (VR) market size was USD 3.10 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach USD 57.55 billion by 2027, exhibiting a growth of 44.3%

### Features:
1. VR Display
    - A VR platform developed by Google, Cardboard is supported by most modern smartphones and requires a cheap headset. 
    - These minimal requirements could ensure wide outreach and acceptability.
    - Developing with Cardboard is well supported by documentation and an online community. Platforms such as Unity support Cardboard development. 
2. VR Content
    - The VR device could emulate a simple classroom setting, consisting of benches, a blackboard and some other objects such as globes and bookshelves to make the setting more realistic.
    - Each student and the teacher can create their own virtual character. These characters can be similar to the Animojis supported by Apple. Several APIs are available to help make these characters.
    - Each student’s character would be assigned a particular desk. The students could turn and view other students and the teacher, and the teacher, the students.
    - The blackboard will be used to display the teacher’s screen or other notes. Students can choose to maximise the blackboard.
3. VR Interaction
    - Students will send requests to other students to create chat bubbles.
    - This will allow students to talk to other students without disturbing the class. Students will also be allowed to share notes in real time. Teachers will be given the functionality to oversee all conversations.
    - NLP and NER can be used to automatically convert speech into text. This will allow students to access transcripts of lectures.   
    - Speech can also be emulated by way of facial expressions using Deep Learning technologies. 
4. Additional
    - Sound: Additional sounds such as ringing of bells can be incorporated. Headsets can be used to deliver sound. 
    - Position Tracking: Not incorporated. Requires additional hardware and frankly not needed. 
    - Head Tracking: Incorporated. Students and teachers can turn their head in six directions to get a good field of view. Supported by most smartphones.
    - Place Illusion: Incorporated. The intention of this application is to create an illusion of being in a classroom.
    - Embodiment Illusion: Not incorporated. The students and teachers embody their own avatars.
    - Plausibility Illusion: Incorporated. Very Important.

### Relative Merits:
1. Advantages
    - Reduces the feeling of social isolation amongst students. Interacting with virtual avatars caters to a immersive experience. Extended mental health application.
    - Lack of distractions leads the students to stay attentive and not get distracted.
    - Since smartphones and headsets are easily available, this technology will be accessible.
    - AI backed teaching will make the experience more efficient.
2. Disadvantages
    - High screen time. A blue light filter lens may be adapted to reduce strain, yet this will be a high cost.
    - Teachers may not be willing to assimilate to trying a new teaching method.
    - Wearing a headset for long periods may tend to be uncomfortable. 

### Impact
 - Quality education will be available irrespective of location. 
 - Simulation of models in fields such as biology and medicine, geology and ocean sciences, will translate into better understanding of concepts. 
 - Conducive to effective learning for students and teaching for teachers. 
 - Push technology ahead. When Apple discontinued the microphone jack it was criticised by many, but that active decision pushed users and other companies to incorporate Bluetooth technologies. As a whole, that move was an inconvenience to many, but it accelerated technology growth.

## This Repo

This is a virtual classroom setting. This has been done importing some premade assets from the net. It includes four walls, a flooring with texture, some benches and chairs for the students and a table for the teacher. Also included is a board and a globe which rotates. There is not much to be done by the user as of now, look around and observe the scene and the objects in it.

All objects have been scaled, rotated and positioned to fit the scene. The flooring has a texture applied and the globe has a rotating animation. I have incorporated two overlapping sounds and have mixed them. The first is the sound of a school bell ringing and the other is the sound of background chatter. A reverberation zone has been used too.

This has been designed for Google Cardboard on an Android phone. You must have android SDK on your laptop and enable device debugging on your phone. Plug in your phone and press build. Takes a while to load. 

### Software requirements:
- Unity 2019.3.15f1 or later
- Make sure to include Android and iOS Build Support during installation.
- Git must be installed and the git executable must be on the PATH environment variable.
